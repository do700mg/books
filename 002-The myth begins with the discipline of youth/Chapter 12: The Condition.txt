The space inside the carriage is vast, with lavish ornaments that rival the comfort and indulgence of home.

Directly in front, as well as on both sides, are soft yellow cushions adorned with delicate floral patterns, large enough to accommodate a person lying across them.

On top, a velvet blanket lies neatly folded, its surface smooth and glossy, untouched by dust.

The windows on both sides are half-open, and in addition to the curtains, delicate beaded curtains hang, their colorful hues catching the light.

As the carriage moves, the beaded curtains clink together, producing a sound as soothing as water flowing over stones.

At the center of the carriage is a square, four-legged table, upon which several items are arranged.

A scroll of *Mingyang Zhi* lies on top, its pages fresh, a character study specially prepared by Lü Le for Meng Zhao’s entertainment.

A plate of purple berries, carefully washed and glistening with an enticing sheen, with small pieces of crushed ice scattered on top.

A plate of exquisitely crafted pastries, their fragrant aroma rich and inviting, with a creamy white color that stirs the appetite, prepared by a skilled chef.

These two items serve to satisfy Meng Zhao’s cravings during the journey, while also replenishing his energy and aiding in the recovery of his internal power.

While indulging in these delights, his cultivation naturally improves—a thoughtful and considerate touch.

Such resources are beyond the reach of the impoverished lower-class martial artists.

There’s a saying that all men are born equal, and perhaps there is some truth to it.

However, the circumstances and backgrounds in which they live are far from equal.

Take Meng Zhao, for instance. His rapid progress in such a short time could be something other martial artists would need to achieve through countless hours of toil and even sacrifice.

In addition to these items, a porcelain incense burner with a sea wave design rests on the table, from which a faint, refreshing fragrance emanates through the small holes in the lid, calming the mind and soothing the spirit.

This, too, subtly aids in the practice of martial arts.

At this moment, Meng Zhao has fully embraced the identity of a noble heir. He peruses the *Mingyang Zhi* with interest, occasionally picking up a berry or pastry to enjoy, thoroughly immersed in the experience.

His *Luohan Tongzi* technique, now at the *Zhengding* (minor completion) stage, works with refined precision and efficiency, absorbing the dense essence within his body, transforming it into pure internal energy and storing it in his dantian.

Moreover, the carriage has been specially designed, and the *Wulin Horse* runs smoothly and steadily, with little jostling, allowing Meng Zhao to lose track of time.

After a while, the fast-moving carriage and the surrounding knights who had been guarding it suddenly come to a halt. A deep, commanding voice rings out from the front:

“Alert!”

The voice, emanating from the scarred man, carries immense internal energy, like a thunderclap that echoes in the air.

As the sound fades, the guards surrounding the carriage draw their swords with swift precision, holding them horizontally across their chests, their blades gleaming in the sunlight, their faces stern and alert.

Crossbows, primed and poisoned, are readied, their deadly bolts glinting with a greenish hue.

If any threat arises, these crossbows will unleash a storm of bolts, striking the enemy with a fierce and sudden assault.

Meng Zhao is startled by the sudden turn of events. His drowsy gaze flickers with a hint of surprise, and instinctively, he grasps the Buddhist beads at his side. A cool, calming energy flows through him, steadying his agitated mind.

He opens half of the carriage door and leans out, asking:

“Le, what’s happening? Why have we stopped?”

Before Lü Le can respond, Meng Zhao's sharp eyes already spot what lies ahead.

The caravan has reached a grove of purple-leaved maples, stretching out like an ocean of violet waves, the breeze stirring the branches in a mesmerizing display.

However, after the scarred man’s command to alert, dozens—perhaps hundreds—of people emerge from the forest, blocking their way, raising a cloud of dust that fills the air and disrupts the ethereal beauty.

These people appear to be refugees, rather than mountain bandits. However, their desperation and destitution make them more pitiful than threatening.

Many hold crude weapons—wooden clubs, pickaxes, and even dry twigs. Some are unarmed, their faces gaunt and their clothes tattered, as though they’ve not had a full meal in days. The group includes men, women, and children.

Such a ragtag group, no matter how numerous, could not pose a threat to the well-trained guards of Meng’s household.

Under the leadership of the scarred man, a single charge from these elite knights would wipe out the group in an instant, leaving no casualties on their side.

Meng Zhao is confident of this.

However, the prosperity and peace within the city, with its thriving citizens and healthy population, makes the presence of refugees outside the city unusual.

Indeed, they exist—but they are numerous.

For this world is plagued not only by natural disasters and human conflict, but by savage beasts as well.

Meng Zhao understands this well.

What is odd, though, is that these refugees, destitute and without support, did not seek aid from the local government. Instead, they boldly stand in their path. This behavior is highly suspicious.

Are they attempting to rob them, or are they simply begging for mercy?

Refugees are not fools; they too are driven by the instinct for survival.

Even if they have turned to banditry, it would be senseless to target a well-armed and powerful caravan like this.

The disparity in strength is so evident that even the naked eye can see it.

Moreover, Meng Zhao’s guards are clearly seasoned warriors, not the sort to be easily deceived or swayed by beggars.

Meng Zhao’s gaze darkens, his brow furrowing. He remains vigilant, no less so than before.

Without expression, he instructs Lü Le:

“Le, this group’s sudden appearance is too strange. Do not act rashly. Be cautious. Give them some loose silver and send them on their way—avoid conflict at all costs. If they do not disperse or approach the caravan, initiate an attack. Do not hesitate.”

Meng Zhao is cautious, perhaps more so than most, as he cherishes life after having lived two lives.

He fears that among these refugees, there may be someone with malicious intent, waiting for the right moment to strike.

Although his guards are elite, an unexpected ambush could lead to unpredictable consequences.

The best solution is to send these people away quickly, keeping them at a safe distance.

Lü Le, having served under Lü Zhong for many years, is no fool. He immediately senses the gravity of the situation, his face growing serious.

With a whip crack that resounds like the hiss of a serpent through the air, the signal is given.

The horses at the front of the carriage stir uneasily, their powerful bodies shifting with a rhythmic, iron-like stomp of their hooves.

Two large men in black quickly spur their horses forward. Given the urgency of the situation, they do not pause to salute Meng Zhao but lean forward on their mounts, awaiting Lü Le’s orders.

If Lü Zhong is the household’s chief steward, Lü Le is his capable deputy, trusted and respected by those in the second household.

Once Lü Le gives the necessary orders, the two men ride off in opposite directions, passing on instructions to the scarred man and Wang Tao, ensuring the prearranged formation is maintained.
