Nightfall, with the moon casting a soft, ethereal glow, the air still and serene, as though the land itself were bathed in tranquil waters.

In the grand city of Nannan, within the western garden of the prestigious Meng family, a young man dressed in purple stood motionless in the spacious, quiet courtyard. His presence illuminated by a faint, reddish light that seemed to glow from the misty surroundings.

His eyes were half-closed, his hands resting crosswise over his chest, fingers interlocked in the pose of the Arhat seal. His expression was solemn and composed, resembling a Buddha statue in a temple, exuding an aura of reverence and discipline.

With full concentration, he focused on the internal energy circulating within him, urging the force within to surge like a tidal wave. His breath rose and fell, steady like the rhythmic pumping of a bellows, creating a powerful gust of air with each inhalation and exhalation.

A faint hum, like the chant of sacred verses, seemed to echo around him, revealing the strength of his organs and muscles, as if a mighty beast lay dormant within.

Under the soft moonlight, his striking appearance became apparent. The young man, around eighteen years of age, had long black hair, gleaming like silk, tied neatly behind his shoulder with a silver knot.

His eyebrows were sharp and slanted, dark as ink, his nose high and proud, and his lips thin yet defined. His facial features were finely sculpted, blending softness with a touch of nobility.

Bathed in the misty red glow, his skin was as fair as jade, and his tall, imposing stature radiated an aura of exceptional strength and grace.

Suddenly, his eyes snapped open. In the dark of the night, they flashed like two bolts of white lightning, their sharpness blinding and impossible to face directly.

A breath of white mist escaped his lips, solidifying into a fine arrow, lingering in the air before dissipating.

The young man exhaled, returning to a composed stance, hands clasped behind his back as he gazed at the full moon in the sky, silently reflecting:

"At last, I have barely mastered this Arhat discipline bestowed upon me. Though I could not open the vast sea-like dantian to lay the strongest foundation, it is still a solid foundation, like a tranquil lake, with room for growth."

The path of martial arts in this world is divided into three stages: Breath Control and Qi Condensation, Qi Transformation into the Sea, and the Unblocking of Meridians—simplified, these are the beginner, intermediate, and advanced stages.

The second stage, Qi Transformation into the Sea, is especially crucial, requiring practitioners to accumulate a vast inner power and open the dantian to form a sea of energy.

It is so vital that it is known as the "Grand Foundation." The dantian thus opened can range from a pond to a sea, with vastly different implications for a martial artist’s potential.

The strength of one's inner power varies dramatically depending on the dantian's size. The weakest have the dantian of a pond, while those who open a sea-like dantian possess immense strength and limitless potential.

In this phase, disparities between martial artists become stark. The strong grow stronger, and the weak grow weaker. Many, especially disciples of prestigious sects, will spend years refining their foundation in this phase, rather than rushing through it.

Being able to open a lake-like dantian at his age is already a commendable achievement.

As for the young man’s origins, they were far from ordinary.

His name was Meng Zhao, the sole heir of the second branch of the prestigious Meng family in Nannan.

Though orphaned, he still had the support of his relatives and the vast family estate waiting to be inherited. Yet, this identity, though genuine, was not his own.

To be precise, the youth was a transmigrant from another world.

In his past life, while observing a fight outside an antique shop, he was accidentally struck and killed. When he awoke, he found himself in a strange world, inhabiting the body of a beggar, ravaged by a deadly disease and on the brink of death from hunger or illness.

By some stroke of fortune, he was rescued by a mysterious figure who brought him to a secret place, a palace-like sanctuary, where he endured over a year of grueling training.

The sole focus of his training was one thing: to impersonate a youth named Meng Zhao.

The reason? His appearance and physique bore a striking resemblance to the real Meng Zhao, with a similar age and features, making him the perfect candidate for such a role.

Thus, he lived a life ten times more arduous than his previous years of study, learning the true Meng Zhao's mannerisms, speech, habits, and mastering a range of essential skills: from language, history, and family genealogy, to martial arts.

He even studied portraits and relationships, meticulously understanding every detail about Meng Zhao’s life and interactions.

Three days ago, under the mysterious figure's guidance, he received a profound transmission of martial knowledge from a middle-aged monk, which purged his body and reshaped his constitution, replenishing his frail body. He also gained over twenty years' worth of pure inner martial arts cultivation, opening a lake-like dantian.

In terms of cultivation, he surpassed the real Meng Zhao.

This was crucial, for while appearance could be easily imitated, martial strength was harder to fake. How could a person who had only trained for a year have the same strength as someone who had spent ten years building a solid foundation?

Subsequently, the mysterious figure orchestrated a swap, replacing the real Meng Zhao with him.

The true Meng Zhao had left home ten years ago, residing in the imperial capital's Great Compassion Temple. Now, returning to his family, he was surrounded by powerful family guards. The swap was only possible because of the mysterious figure's immense power.

The mysterious figure’s knowledge of Meng Zhao and the Meng family was vast, hinting at a far-reaching network of intelligence.

What gave Meng Zhao some comfort, however, was that the mysterious figure had not immediately tasked him with any dangerous missions. Instead, he was instructed to assimilate into the Meng family and play the role of Meng Zhao.

He was essentially a sleeper agent, perhaps not called into action for years, which reduced the risk of exposure—a small consolation.

Suddenly, a hurried footstep approached from the stone archway to the west of the courtyard, drawing Meng Zhao’s thoughts back to the present.

He straightened his clothes, his previously solemn expression softening into a warm, serene smile. His demeanor transformed, exuding an aura of gentleness and grace, akin to a gentleman.

Before him appeared a young man dressed in yellow, walking briskly with a confident gait. 

The boy, around eighteen or nineteen, had a round face and large eyes, his skin dark and his build unremarkable. Though not handsome, there was an infectious energy about him, lively and spirited.

Meng Zhao instinctively recalled the boy’s background:

Lu Le, an orphan adopted by the Meng family’s third-generation servant, and a close confidant since Meng Zhao's return to the family.

The boy knelt respectfully before Meng Zhao, handing him a gilded invitation with red and black inscriptions.

"Young master, this is an invitation from the second son, who requests your presence at Yalan Pavilion to enjoy wine and moon-gazing."

Lu Le’s voice carried an uncommon coolness for one so young, but it was pleasant to the ear.

Meng Zhao smiled, gently taking the invitation and studying it. He then tossed it into Lu Le's arms, asking, "Lu Le, what do you think is the true intention behind my second brother’s invitation? Should I attend the banquet?"

Though he was an impostor, he knew the Meng family better than the real Meng Zhao, who had been absent for ten years. He was certain that his second brother, Meng Wenyan, did not invite him with simple intentions.
