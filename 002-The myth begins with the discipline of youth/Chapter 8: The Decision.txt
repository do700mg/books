Meng Zhao slowly absorbed the essence of vital energy. The improvement in his Arhat Youth technique was not immediately apparent, but the progress was nonetheless tangible.

In truth, this method of internal cultivation is the norm.

After all, the essence of internal martial arts lies in gradual accumulation and the principle of "thick accumulation leading to sudden release."

Much like when he was suddenly bestowed a surge of internal power through the secretive transmission of energy, it was purely by chance—an unexpected gift, a stroke of fortune.

He himself may have gained immensely from it, but the monk who granted him the transmission likely paid a severe price, perhaps even losing his life or sustaining crippling injury, with no real benefit to show for it.

Typically, such self-sacrificial acts are only performed by those on the brink of death or in dire straits, who seek to pass on their knowledge or abilities to another.

Taking a white handkerchief from the side, Meng Zhao wiped the corner of his mouth. He assessed the situation with a clear mind and commanded,

"First, find out who Meng Xi and Meng Wen have placed within our ranks. Leave no stone unturned, at the very least ensure we have a complete understanding.

How we proceed will depend on my meeting with Uncle later.

As for the estate, let's visit in the afternoon. Ah Le, gather a few trustworthy and capable individuals to accompany us."

These decisions, though swiftly made, were carefully considered by Meng Zhao.

It was indeed underhanded for Meng Xi and Meng Wen to exploit the second branch in Meng Zhao’s absence, drawing resources in such a covert manner. It was something they would be ashamed to admit, a betrayal of trust that would surely earn them disdain.

Yet, Meng Zhao refrained from confronting them directly. The core reason was simple: his current strength was insufficient.

The untimely death of his father left him without support, and his lack of power meant he could not afford to make bold moves. 

He knew that relying on weak blood ties alone, without a solid foundation, would lead to disaster. Turning on them too early would invite ruin.

Did he truly believe that the family head, Meng Jizu, and his third uncle, Meng Hongdao, were unaware of the brothers’ actions?

No, they undoubtedly knew, and since they hadn’t interfered, their stance was clear.

However, now that he had returned, he believed the two brothers would likely reconsider their actions.

It was best to first gather all necessary information before taking further action.

Even if the two brothers were blinded by their greed, the elders would not turn a blind eye forever. Eventually, they would reach a conclusion.

As for the estate, Meng Zhao wasn’t overly concerned about the ruined medicinal fields, the loss of herbs, or even the deaths. 

While the losses seemed considerable, they were not catastrophic for the second branch, whose influence was still minor.

The true reason for his visit was to send a message. 

The real master of the second branch, the legitimate heir of the Meng family, the fourth young master of the next generation, Meng Zhao, had returned.

This action, while insignificant to some, was crucial. For those with ambitions to fully control the second branch and even merge the entire Meng family, reputation was an essential tool for gathering support.

Moreover, it served the secondary purpose of undermining the influence of Lü Zhong and Lü Le in the second branch.

Meng Zhao had no doubts about their loyalty, but such precautions were necessary.

Lü Le, upon hearing the first command, nodded in understanding. As for the estate, he had his adoptive father there, so there was no need for Meng Zhao to make the journey. It would be a waste of time and energy.

Nevertheless, as a loyal attendant, Lü Le bowed his head and responded to Meng Zhao's orders, leaving immediately to make the necessary arrangements.

After completely absorbing the essence from his breakfast, Meng Zhao did not idle away his time.

Accompanied by a servant, he made his way to the private vault of the second branch.

This vault had been left by his father, Meng Zheng'an, and was designed by a master of mechanisms. It housed a collection of rare and unique treasures, with a high likelihood of containing objects that could power the Zhaotian Mirror.

Unfortunately, his father had never taken an interest in such collections, and over the past decade, Lü Zhong had not actively spent money to acquire rare items to fill the vault.

Thus, the haul, while promising, was limited.

Meng Zhao entered the vault with the intention of scavenging for energy sources.

To him, the energy needed by the Zhaotian Mirror was a shortcut to greater strength, the gateway to transcendent power. Naturally, it was his priority.

After about fifteen minutes, Meng Zhao stepped out of the vault with a wide grin, his excitement palpable.

At that moment, the interface on the Zhaotian Mirror in his mind had updated:

"Name: Meng Zhao  
Constitution: ?????  
Energy: 5400  
Cultivation: Qi Accumulation and Sea Transformation (Lake-level Dantian Formation)  
Martial Arts:  
  - Arhat Youth Technique (Beginner)  
  - Thirteen Forms of Arhat Hands (Beginner)  
  - Plum Blossom Stance (Beginner)  
Fusion Martial Arts: Status (Disabled)"

The contents of the panel were nearly identical to the previous night’s, except for the 5400 energy points, which was a substantial increase.

This accounted for Meng Zhao’s delighted expression upon leaving the vault.

Within the Meng family’s private collection, Meng Zhao, using the innate reactions of the Zhaotian Mirror, had found around ten ancient artifacts and treasures that responded to the mirror’s energy-sensing capabilities.

Among them, a bronze sword of unknown age and origin provided him with the highest energy boost of about 1600 points—far more than the jade Buddhist beads he had been toying with.

However, there was also a beautifully crafted jade ring adorned with intricate dragon and phoenix motifs, labeled as an antique from the Yuan Dynasty. To his disappointment, it provided a meager ten energy points, leading him to suspect it might be a counterfeit.

Nevertheless, the outcome was favorable, confirming that his earlier assumptions and strategy were correct.

He speculated that artifacts once handled by martial artists should yield greater energy and be more valuable.

The only disappointment was the "Constitution" field, which still displayed four large question marks.

However, unlike before, the Zhaotian Mirror seemed to have regained some of its lost spiritual sensitivity, subtly indicating that Meng Zhao's constitution was indeed extraordinary—of a special nature.

Yet, with only 5000 energy points, he was still far from able to uncover the true source of his unique constitution.

While this discovery alleviated some of his doubts, it also led him to abandon the idea of exploring his constitution further in the short term.

Accumulating energy points, for now, was no longer a feasible approach.

Instead, with 5000 energy points at his disposal, Meng Zhao felt a renewed sense of excitement. He was now eager to explore the practical applications of the Zhaotian Mirror.

His main priority, however, was still to convert his abstract wealth into tangible personal strength.

With the fierce ongoing conflict between the Meng and Sun families, and the escalating tension, he knew that strengthening himself was paramount.

He had already instructed Lü Le to choose capable and loyal individuals to protect him, but ultimately, his own strength must serve as his trump card.

Moreover, with such a significant amount of energy, he could likely enhance a few martial arts techniques without running out of points, and when the time came, he could use the surplus to strengthen the Meng family’s legendary martial arts.

As he fiddled with the smooth jade beads, their rhythmic clicking resounding crisply in the quiet room, Meng Zhao's plans took shape. He collected himself, suppressing his excitement, and swiftly headed toward his courtyard.
