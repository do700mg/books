When it comes to physique, one must inevitably touch upon the history and background of the world we live in today.

According to Meng Zhao's understanding from the mysterious figure, the land he currently resides on is called Chixian Shenzhou, vast and boundless. Though the Great Yong Dynasty is indeed large, it occupies only a small portion of the central region.

In ancient times, Chixian Shenzhou was a land where gods and demons existed.

During that era, countless powerful beings roamed the heavens and earth, capable of burning the sky and boiling the seas, and plucking stars and moons was but a trivial task.

There were also hundreds of tribes standing between heaven and earth, with demons, ghosts, and monsters rampant, while humans were but a minor race.

Eventually, for reasons unknown, the calamity of the heavens descended, causing the gods and demons to vanish, the monsters and ghosts to disappear, and ushering in the era of the ancient tribes.

During that time, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, along with powerful figures from Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Legalism, deciphered the supreme martial arts from the relics left by the ancient gods and demons, achieving transcendent and mythical realms of power.

Thus, they forged ahead through countless hardships, clearing a path for humanity and leading it to ever greater heights, eventually becoming the supreme rulers of the land and dominating the world.

During the Middle Ages, both dynasties and sects flourished. The Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming—nine supreme dynasties—suppressed Chixian Shenzhou. The various sects also emerged from their mountain retreats, gathering disciples and strengthening their power, creating a great symphony of a hundred sects.

Countless battles ensued, resulting in several calamities that shook Shenzhou.

It wasn't until the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the last vestiges of the ancient glory, that history entered the modern age.

For a century after the Ming’s demise, Chixian Shenzhou was embroiled in chaos, with numerous warlords vying for power. It was not until the Supreme Assembly at Mount Tai that the founder of the Great Yong Dynasty, Emperor Beitang Gong, put an end to the strife.

Returning to the topic at hand, while the ancient gods and demons have long disappeared, their vast and mighty power remains eternal.

Some particularly powerful individuals among the hundreds of tribes left behind their bloodlines, passing on special powers. This is the origin of the first unique physiques.

For instance, the Chaos Body, capable of encompassing all laws; the Battle-Saint Physique, unmatched in combat and attack; the Star Body, which communicates with the stars; and the Golden Li Saint Body, impervious to harm—each has terrifying, god-like powers, making them truly one of a kind.

There are also figures like the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the Taoist and Buddha Ancestors, who could pass on their extraordinary strength through special means, creating new physiques, such as the Nine Dragons Ascension Body, the Supreme Tao Body, the Tathagata Saint Body, and so on.

From this, one could say that these beings were no different from the ancient gods and demons.

Over thousands of years, humanity’s numbers exploded, and some fortunate individuals were born with innate gifts, inheriting these special physiques. They cultivated supreme martial arts and shocked the world, further enhancing the power of these physiques.

This is why Meng Zhao holds great expectations for the possibility of having a special physique himself.

If the Mirror of Heaven is considered a later acquisition, with the risk of losing it, then a special physique is an innate advantage, something that cannot be taken away.

"But is this really true?" Meng Zhao wondered. "If I do have a special physique, which one could it be?"

He found himself in deep thought. He didn't know much about physiques but understood that each one was distinct and presented in vastly different ways.

For instance, the Chaos Body, which can embrace all laws, might only appear once in ten thousand years. But once it does, it is undoubtedly a peerless genius.

Such individuals directly enter the realm of innate strength, and if they don't perish prematurely, they are destined to become figures of myth.

The only two recorded Chaos Bodies were Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Liu Che, who subdued the four corners of the world, and Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, Li Shimin. Both were so powerful that even their fathers' brilliance was overshadowed by their own, leaving behind legendary tales.

Similarly, the Star Body, the Solar Body, the Lunar Body, the Zi Wei Body, the Breaking Army Body, and others are numerous and highly varied in their manifestations.

At the mortal stage, those possessing such a physique are indistinguishable from ordinary people, and their traits cannot be identified.

Only upon reaching the innate realm, when one begins to absorb the energy of the heavens and earth, will the corresponding celestial power awaken. This marks the beginning of their "Star Fate."

Whether in battle or in the progress of cultivation, these individuals are far ahead of the rest, with a high ceiling of potential.

However, because of this, the Star Body also has the potential for concealment.

Thus, Meng Zhao found it difficult to identify a physique that matched his among the myriad of types.

After all, he exhibited no unusual traits and appeared just like any other person.

Had it not been for the Mirror of Heaven revealing an anomaly in his physique, Meng Zhao might not have dared to entertain such lofty hopes.

After much contemplation, Meng Zhao came to the realization that in order to uncover the true nature of his physique, he would need to rely on the Mirror of Heaven.

The reason the Mirror of Heaven could not clearly reveal his physique might be due to insufficient energy.

Once he absorbed enough energy points, the mystery should be unraveled.

As for martial arts, Meng Zhao had limited energy points at the moment and did not plan to use them lightly.

He intended to wait for his ancestor, Meng Jizu, to return and pass on the Meng family’s divine skills. With the energy points, his martial arts should improve significantly.

For now, the three martial arts he had mastered would have to suffice. If he gained more energy points tomorrow, he would attempt to upgrade them.

In a refined room within the northern courtyard of the Meng estate, a young man wearing a golden crown reclined on a soft couch draped in tiger skin, reading a scroll. His voice was deep and hoarse, yet carried a profound resonance.

His appearance bore a striking resemblance to Meng Wen, with a stronger jawline, and a small black mole at the corner of his right eyebrow.

While not particularly handsome, his demeanor exuded authority, giving him a regal presence.

At that moment, a young servant in green quickly approached from behind a screen. Bowing low, he kneeled before the young man on the couch and softly spoke:

"Young master, I've just received word that Meng Zhao has been invited to a banquet and met with Second Young Master. During the gathering, Second Young Master tried to win him over, gifting him the beauty, Chu Yao, and a Buddhist prayer bead made of the precious Bi Xuan spirit jade. 

Meng Zhao refused the beauty but accepted the prayer bead. How should we respond?"

Meng Xi's eyes narrowed as he slowly lifted his gaze from the scroll, a chilling light flashing like an arrow aimed at the servant. He let out a cold snort and sneered:

"Fourth Brother has been stuck in that monastery for ten years. Perhaps he's become foolish from chanting, unable to distinguish between honor and humility. 

Instead of coming to pay respects to his elder brother, he goes to Second Brother. What does he think he's doing?"

After a moment's contemplation, Meng Xi suppressed his displeasure and ordered:

"Keep the people in the second branch's enterprises in check for now. Let’s see what Fourth Brother does before making any further plans. 

However, the profits from the Red Leaf Ginseng and Wolf Poison Grass are too great to ignore. I must have them. 

Find an opportunity to tell Fourth Brother that I want to buy that land from him. As his elder brother, I won’t treat him unfairly in terms of price."

The green-clad servant, Lu Shun, trembled slightly. He had served his master for many years and understood him well. His master was domineering by nature, raised with an air of authority, and highly sensitive to any threats.

Meng Zhao’s actions tonight—meeting with Second Young Master and accepting the gift—had likely crossed a line for the elder master.

But this was not for him to worry about. After memorizing the instructions, Lu Shun bowed once more before leaving to carry out his tasks.

Once the servant had left, Meng Xi furiously hurled the scroll to the floor, his expression grim.

Meng Zhao had been absent for ten years, and only the old man, Lü Zhong, had kept the house running. Meng Xi had long set his sights on the wealth of the second branch. 

Over the years, he had quietly siphoned money from the second branch, using it to strengthen his own influence, saving him considerable effort and trouble.

But now, with Meng Zhao’s return, he knew such schemes could no longer continue. He would have to pull back.

However, he could not allow the second branch to fall under the control of Meng Wen. That would be a devastating blow to him.

In the dim light, Meng Xi's face was devoid of expression, but his eyes burned with a cold, sinister light.

"The position of family head is mine, and only mine. Fourth Brother, I hope you recognize your place. Otherwise..."
