However, Meng Zhao possessed the method of visualizing white bones to sever desires, a secret technique that none of the men within or outside the pavilion possessed.

As a result, they were all drawn to the sudden appearance of the exceptionally beautiful woman.

A few of the black-clad guards, whose willpower was weak and whose resolve faltered, displayed shamelessly lustful expressions, nearly drooling.

Meng Zhao sat at ease, his gaze sharp and unwavering, scanning the crowd.

He paid particular attention to Meng Qinghuai, as this man had previously shown signs of abnormality and harbored animosity towards him.

Upon observing, he noted that when Meng Qinghuai saw the woman, his expression briefly reflected indulgence, but it quickly returned to normal, demonstrating mental fortitude.

Moreover, Meng Zhao couldn't shake the feeling that Meng Qinghuai avoided the woman more out of instinctive fear than a desire for distance or respect.

There was a clear distinction: the former was born of innate fear, while the latter was a deliberate attempt at avoidance.

"Fourth Brother, this woman's name is Chu Yao, only eighteen years of age. Not only is her beauty unparalleled, but she is also a gifted singer and dancer, with a fragrance that seems to emanate from her very being. She is truly a gem among mortals."

"Half a month ago, my elder brother gave her to me, though I have not touched her, and she remains pure to this day."

"Considering you’ve just returned home and have no one to serve you, I, your second brother, offer her as a gift. Please, do not refuse."

As Meng Wen spoke, he did not even glance at Chu Yao, appearing entirely indifferent to the beauty of such a woman.

His demeanor was remarkably casual as he explained her background and identity in detail.

Meng Zhao instantly understood Meng Wen's intentions. This was not merely a gesture of goodwill; it could very well be a calculated move to stir up trouble.

With the brothers' strained relationship, which was so fraught with tension that it could almost be felt in the air, it was clear that this beautiful woman was a hot potato.

Perhaps Meng Wen's real aim was not simply to buy Meng Zhao's favor, but rather to test him.

"Fourth Brother, you may not know, but I have already cultivated the Arhat Boy Skill at the Great Compassion Temple, which allows me to generate pure Yang Qi and maintain my chastity. Therefore, your kind gesture is appreciated, but unnecessary."

Upon hearing the mention of the Arhat Boy Skill, both Meng Wen and Meng Qinghuai's expressions changed. They stared at Meng Zhao in surprise, their gazes filled with a mix of curiosity and disbelief.

Their looks were odd, as if they were wondering why he would choose such a martial art.

It was not that the skill was subpar—after all, the Arhat Boy Skill was one of the three secret, supreme martial arts of the Great Compassion Temple. If cultivated successfully, it not only provided immense internal energy but also had the power to dispel evil. It could strengthen one's body, improve one’s natural aptitude, and assist in cultivating other internal arts—benefits that were numerous.

Had it not been for the favor of Emperor Beitang Sheng, Meng Zhao would never have had the opportunity to learn this art.

However, there was a downside to this skill: it required one to maintain a pure and youthful body to achieve maximum progress.

For monks, this was no great difficulty, as many of them remained celibate well into their old age. 

But Meng Zhao was not a monk.

In general, the sons of wealthy families, especially those of noble houses, never chose such an art. 

First, families needed heirs to continue their bloodlines—a matter even ordinary families could not afford to neglect.

Second, abstaining from women was far too difficult for men, especially the young masters of noble families.

For example, Meng Wen, at the age of sixteen, had already lost his virginity to a servant girl, and though he had not yet formally married, he had no fewer than ten women in his household, and more on the side for entertainment.

By contrast, Meng Qinghuai, though not as indulgent as Meng Wen, had still kept two beautiful women secretly.

Thus, they could not comprehend Meng Zhao’s ascetic lifestyle, one that seemed as restrictive as that of a monk.

However, after thinking for a moment, Meng Wen surmised that Meng Zhao had spent ten years in the monastery, and probably had no idea of the pleasures women could bring. 

Meng Wen hesitated briefly, then with a sigh, chuckled and said, "I see. Fourth Brother, you have suffered. 

"However, this woman’s beauty is extraordinary. Even if you keep her by your side as a servant, it would be far better than not having her at all."

Meng Zhao sighed, interrupting him, and with a shy expression, said, "Second Brother, my willpower is insufficient. If such a beauty were to appear before me daily, I fear I would be unable to control myself and my cultivation would suffer. Therefore, I must respectfully decline."

Having said this plainly, Meng Wen, though somewhat disappointed, could not press the matter further. He waved his hand with a resigned smile.

The woman, Chu Yao, cast a slightly resentful glance at Meng Zhao, then bowed to the men in the pavilion and walked away. Even her retreating figure remained ethereally beautiful.

It was likely that she was cursing in her heart—what others would fight to possess, the three brothers of the Meng family barely acknowledged her, and she was still a maiden, which surely bruised her pride.

Meng Wen, however, was not distressed. While surprised, he was not without other plans. He spoke again, "Since you refuse the beauty, there is yet another gift I hope you will not decline."

Saying this, he instructed a servant to bring forth another treasure and placed it on the table, smiling.

"Fourth Brother, after spending ten years in the temple, you must be familiar with Buddhist treasures. This jade Buddha bead was an item I stumbled upon by chance. Its material is extraordinary, and it has been blessed by a high monk with decades of Buddhist teachings, imbued with the essence of Buddha."

"It offers protection for the mind and enhances the cultivation of internal energy. I wish to gift it to you."

The jade Buddha beads, twelve in total, glimmered with a translucent sheen and were strung together by an almost invisible silver thread. They emitted a faint, ethereal glow.

Even without understanding their value, one could tell from mere observation that this was no ordinary item.

Yet Meng Zhao’s expression remained impassive, untouched by the beauty of the gift. He was about to politely refuse.

After all, he had come only to make a gesture, not to become embroiled in the conflict between the two brothers.

As for the Buddha beads, he was entirely indifferent—after all, he was not the desperate monk who had spent ten years in a temple.

But then, something unexpected happened.

As Meng Zhao gazed at the jade Buddha beads, a flash of dazzling blue light seemed to momentarily blind his vision. Suddenly, an overwhelming desire to possess the beads surged within him.

"I must have these beads, or else I feel I will lose something important."

This sensation, so sudden and so intense, left Meng Zhao puzzled. It was the first time he had experienced such a feeling in this world, even after more than a year of living here.

Could it be that his "golden finger" had finally activated, granting him the ability to discern treasures?

With this thought, his heart began to race, and without further hesitation, he smiled with satisfaction, "Then, I will accept this gift with gratitude."

He called for Lü Le to take the beads and keep them safe.

Simultaneously, he handed over a gift of his own—a present he had chosen from the rewards bestowed upon him by the imperial court. While not as precious as the jade beads, it was still an appropriate gesture.

Upon seeing this, Meng Wen’s expression relaxed further. Their conversation grew more amicable, and it was clear that Meng Wen was satisfied with how things had unfolded.

He had invited Meng Zhao to gauge the second house’s stance. Now that Meng Zhao had accepted the gift, it was clear he would not easily side with his elder brother.

That was already enough. The last thing Meng Wen feared was for the second house to align with his elder brother, which would turn the tables dramatically against him.

As for Meng Qinghuai, under the deliberate neglect of both Meng Zhao and Meng Wen, he had become little more than a background figure.

Sitting quietly by himself, he sipped his drink with a detached gaze, occasionally looking at the two brothers with a mocking expression.

However, at that moment, Meng Zhao was far too preoccupied with the jade Buddha beads and the inexplicable surge of desire within him to care about the familial drama unfolding around him.

He had done what he needed to do, and there was no longer any need to linger.

Though Meng Wen had not achieved his initial aim, he was still content with the outcome and did not press for further interaction.

As per Meng Zhao’s wishes, he had the servants escort him and Lü Le out of the Pavilion of Blooming Flowers.

Meanwhile, Meng Wen turned his attention to comforting the discontented Meng Qinghuai. 

Though he was displeased with Meng Qinghuai’s behavior today and had some doubts, he would not criticize him harshly. After all, Meng Qinghuai was still useful to him—vital even.

If it had been anyone else who had interfered with his plans, they would have long been cast out to feed the fish.
