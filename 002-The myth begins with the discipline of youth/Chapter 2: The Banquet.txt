The Meng family, a prominent clan of Jizhou, is one of the most illustrious families in the land.

Their ancestor, Meng Shentong, was a legendary hero of his time. Some 130 years ago, during the supreme summit at Mount Tai, he supported Beitang Gong in establishing the Great Yong Dynasty, thus founding the Southern An Marquisate and the Meng family’s unbroken line of nobility, making them one of the empire's most honored and influential families.

The current head of the Meng family, and the Marquis of Southern An, is Meng Ji, Meng Zhao’s paternal uncle. He has two sons and one daughter with his wife. 

The eldest son, Meng Xi, is twenty-four, while the younger, Meng Wen, is two years younger than his brother.

From the intelligence Meng Zhao had gathered from the mysterious figure, he learned that, in their youth, the two brothers were fairly harmonious—one could even say they maintained a cordial and respectful relationship. However, once they reached adulthood, their relationship quickly deteriorated.

The cause of this rift was, as one might expect, the coveted position of heir to the Meng family. The allure of wealth and power had set brother against brother, for even in matters of family, greed could tear apart the closest bonds.

This, of course, was not a rare occurrence. Even in Meng Zhao’s previous life, in what was considered a relatively peaceful society, there were numerous instances of brothers turning against one another over inheritance disputes.

Over the past year, the tension between Meng Xi and Meng Wen had escalated, and they had become fierce rivals, with their conflicts permeating every aspect of Meng family affairs—fighting over wealth, land, and prestige.

Though Meng Zhao had only just returned to the family, as the head of the second house, he had inevitably become a pawn in their battle—either a target to be courted or undermined.

Lü Le, though outwardly meek and cautious in front of Meng Zhao, was sharp-witted and well-informed due to Lü Zhong’s careful tutelage. Understanding the complex situation in the Meng household, he responded with caution, saying,

"Young Master, I believe the second young master’s intentions are far from simple."

"First, he seeks to win your favor, perhaps offering you wealth and power to draw you to his side, thereby bolstering his own strength."

"Second, should you attend the banquet, even without making any promises, the news will likely reach the eldest young master. Given his nature, any hint of favoritism towards the second young master may lead to significant discord, and that could be detrimental to you."

Lü Le’s analysis was astute. Meng Zhao nodded, acknowledging the wisdom in his words. Lü Le understood the dangers of being caught in the internal strife of the first house, where ambitions ran high. Yet, Lü Le had overlooked one crucial detail: Meng Zhao's unique position.

Meng Zhao’s life had been fraught with misfortune. His mother died in childbirth, and at the tender age of seven, his father, Meng Zheng'an, perished from a fatal mishap while practicing martial arts. 

When the new emperor, Beitang Sheng, ascended the throne, the dynasty was beset by natural disasters—earthquakes, floods, and famine ravaged the land. Amidst the chaos, rumors spread, and in some remote areas, uprisings broke out. Though swiftly quelled, they left Beitang Sheng deeply troubled.

The emperor, consulting the Imperial Astronomer, was advised that the disturbances in the heavens were the cause of these calamities. To quell the disaster, thirty-six noble youths were to be sent to the Great Compassionate Temple for ten years of prayer and fasting. It was believed that only through this ritual could the empire’s misfortune be dispelled.

And so, at the tender age of eight, Meng Zhao became one of those chosen thirty-six, embarking on a decade-long spiritual journey.

After completing his ten-year ordeal, Meng Zhao finally returned to the family.

Given this background, Meng Zhao’s bond with the Meng family was more one of blood than of affection.

Had he returned home and kept his distance, resisting full integration into the family and treating his brothers as potential threats, how would his elders perceive him?

Leaving aside any notions of conspiracy, after a decade’s absence, it would be difficult to reject an invitation from his cousin to share a meal and enjoy a drink—especially when his absence had been so long. His elders would find it hard to accept his refusal.

Meng Zhao’s uncle, Meng Ji, and his third uncle, Meng Hongdao, were both conservative patriarchs who valued family honor. A person who distanced himself from the family or disregarded elders would never be looked upon kindly.

Thus, after weighing the consequences, Meng Zhao decided that it would be better to meet with his elder family members and earn their favor.

He made a decisive gesture, turning to Lü Le with a command, “Prepare yourself, Lü Le. We shall attend the banquet. Choose an appropriate gift from the imperial rewards I have received. Make sure it’s not lacking in respect.”

Lü Le, though puzzled, complied without hesitation, bowing his head and replying, “Understood, Young Master.”

The Meng family estate was vast and grand, with palatial halls, intricate gardens, flowing streams, and scenic landscapes. After passing through three long corridors, eight courtyards, and four towers, they finally arrived at the north garden, where the banquet was to be held.

Two imposing men clad in black stood at attention, guarding the entrance with a solemn air. Lü Le, aware of the strict security at the banquet, presented the invitation to one of the guards. After confirming their identity, the guard led them into the courtyard.

At the white stone pavilion where the banquet was set, the scene was one of military precision. Several burly guards stood like silent statues, scanning the surroundings with sharp eyes.

The pavilion was lit by colored glass lanterns, their glow turning the area as bright as day. Exotic flowers and fragrant plants surrounded the pavilion, filling the air with a delightful scent, creating an ideal setting for drinking and admiring the moon.

Within the pavilion, two men were already seated, sharing wine and conversation.

One was Meng Wen, the second son of the Meng family, dressed in fine clothes and a golden crown. His sharp eyebrows and slender features gave him an air of composure and authority.

The other man, though plain in appearance, had a cold and calculating aura. His dark eyes glinted with an unsettling intensity, evoking a sense of unease.

Meng Zhao stepped confidently up the stairs, his warm smile never faltering. He clasped his hands in a polite salute to Meng Wen, speaking with a tone of slight self-reproach, “Apologies for my tardiness, Second Brother. I kept you waiting.”

Meng Wen chuckled heartily, standing to shake Meng Zhao’s hand. “Don’t be so formal, Fourth Brother. You’ve endured hardships during your ten years away from home. It’s my fault for pulling you out before you had a chance to rest.”

His demeanor was open and amiable, his words sincere, which made Meng Zhao feel a bit more at ease.

It was no wonder he dared to contest the position of family head with his elder brother. He had a certain charm and capability.

Despite being the eldest son, Meng Xi was no match for Meng Wen in terms of demeanor and influence.

After they had seated themselves, Meng Wen smiled and introduced another figure, “Let me introduce you to Meng Qinghuai, a distant relative of the Meng family. He is highly favored by my father and is like a brother to me.”

Meng Zhao greeted Meng Qinghuai politely, his smile steady, “Ah, so it is Brother Qinghuai. I’ve heard much about you—the young hero of the Meng family, known not only for your martial prowess but also for your talents in strengthening the family. Today, I see you are truly a dragon among men.”

Meng Zhao had never heard of this person from the mysterious figure, so he remained cautious. Clearly, Meng Qinghuai had no connection with the true Meng Zhao, and he would need to be wary.

However, Meng Qinghuai’s reaction was far from warm. He did not acknowledge Meng Zhao directly, merely grunting in acknowledgment.

A cold chill ran down Meng Zhao’s spine. His instincts screamed that something was off, as he remembered the icy expressions exchanged between Meng Qinghuai and Meng Wen earlier. This man harbored disdain and even hostility toward him. 

Meng Zhao briefly wondered whether Qinghuai had sensed his true identity—that he was an impostor.

But quickly, he dismissed the thought. If even Meng Wen had not noticed, how could a mere distant relative unmask him?

Meng Wen, sensing the awkwardness, laughed lightly and cleared his throat. “Ah, Fourth Brother, do not take offense. Qinghuai can be a bit distant, but once you get to know him, you’ll find he’s warm-hearted. When I first met him, he ignored me completely. So, consider this a sign of his respect for you.”

Meng Zhao nodded faintly, not continuing the conversation. Likewise, Meng Qinghuai showed no sign of warmth, his lips curling into a subtle sneer—not at Meng Wen, but at Meng Zhao.

Outside the pavilion, Lü Le stood quietly, holding a gift box in his hands, watching everything unfold with a cold gleam in his eyes as he regarded Meng Qinghuai with increasing suspicion.
