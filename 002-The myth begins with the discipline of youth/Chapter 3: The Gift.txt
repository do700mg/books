At this moment, Meng Zhao was indeed somewhat angered, yet his cultivation of inner peace was profound, and his mind well-guarded, so he showed no outward sign of his irritation.

Astutely, Meng Zhao also noticed something rather unusual—Meng Qinghuai’s hostility was too blatant.

Although Meng Zhao’s previous pleasantries had been somewhat flattering, there was no denying that Meng Qinghuai was indeed a formidable individual, one who had risen to prominence from a distant branch of the family before ultimately gaining the recognition of the Meng clan.

To suggest that he lacked the ability to control his emotions or conceal his enmity would be an underestimation of the man’s capabilities.

Given that Meng Qinghuai and Meng Wen shared a bond akin to brothers, it was odd that he would openly display such hostility, especially when aware of Meng Wen’s intention to win Meng Zhao over. Was this not strange?

Suppressing a flicker of confusion and doubt, Meng Zhao paid no further attention to Meng Qinghuai and focused all his energy on dealing with Meng Wen.

The second cousin indeed seemed intent on courting his favor. After smoothing things over with Meng Qinghuai, he began reminiscing about their childhood friendship.

He spoke of how reluctant he had been when Meng Zhao was sent to Yujing City, how deeply it had pained him, and how he had always kept him in his thoughts over the years.

The appeal to familial ties was quite strong, and the sincerity in his tone was enough to make one feel moved, without feeling insincere.

Meng Zhao naturally went along with it, sharing a few anecdotes from his time in Yujing City and occasionally complaining about the hardships he faced at the Great Mercy Temple.

It almost seemed as though he had truly experienced these things—the acting was flawless.

Once the mood was suitably warm, Meng Wen delivered a blunt and overt expression of concern, then smoothly changed the subject.

"Ah, I’ve long known that your life in that temple must have been difficult, but I never imagined it would be so harsh. Truly, it must have been a great burden on you."

"However, now the hardships are behind you."

"Now, you not only hold the esteemed position of one of the Thirty-Six Heavenly Guardians, but your rank is also that of a third-rank official, a position of great honor."

"Returning to the family, you’re set to inherit Uncle’s legacy. In the future, who knows, I might even have to rely on your assistance."

As these words were spoken, Meng Zhao subtly sensed the growing complexity in Meng Qinghuai’s mood, and the coldness and jealousy in his occasional glances became all the more evident.

This, Meng Zhao believed, was a true reflection of his feelings.

The Heavenly Guardians were an elite group created by the emperor, with only thirty-six members, each one selected to represent a star in the heavens. Though their duties were few and their power limited, their status was exalted, with numerous privileges attached. It was a position where the workload was light, but the rewards were ample, and the status immeasurably high.

This was all due to the fact that, as a child, Meng Zhao had been sent to the Great Mercy Temple under the emperor’s command, where he spent ten years in ascetic training, reciting scriptures and praying for blessings.

Whether or not his efforts truly averted any disasters was unclear, but the hardships endured could not be denied.

As a result, once he had completed his spiritual training, he and the other thirty-five companions were honored by the emperor, and the Heavenly Guardianship was one of the rewards.

Meng Zhao had been granted the title of the Tianshang Star, along with a seal, a waist plaque, and the Tianshang Blade—three treasures bestowed by the emperor.

In terms of influence, Meng Zhao’s rank in the Meng family was second only to that of his uncle, the Duke of Naan, Meng Jizu.

Not to mention, in addition to the prestigious position of a Heavenly Guardian, Meng Zhao also stood to inherit the vast family fortune left by his father, making his future one of unparalleled wealth, power, and influence.

It was no wonder that Meng Qinghuai was unsettled by this.

The comparison to his own struggles was painful to accept.

Meng Wen’s words were curious, particularly the last line. On one hand, he was clearly attempting to win him over, lowering his stance, yet on the other, his tone lacked formality, as though it were a joke.

Meng Zhao smiled, silently watching Meng Wen, not responding.

It was already a concession to play along with this charade of deep brotherly affection. To expect him to truly step in, openly supporting him, was an overestimation.

At this moment, Meng Qinghuai, who had been observing silently for some time, unexpectedly spoke, his tone sharp with a hint of sarcasm.

"Fourth Young Master returns to the family and will soon take over the Second Branch's affairs—such joyous news indeed."

"Today, I happen to have a gift for Fourth Young Master. Come, bring it forth."

As he spoke, a burly man in black emerged from outside the pavilion, holding a copper box, clearly prepared in advance.

Meng Qinghuai rose to accept the box, dismissing the black-clad man with a gesture. He shot Meng Zhao a thinly-veiled, mocking smile before opening the box.

Inside was a palm-sized stone sculpture of a tiger, which he placed on the corner of the table.

The carving was skillful, the tiger’s form quite vivid. Yet, unlike the fierce, proud kings of the beasts one might expect, this stone tiger had dull, lifeless eyes, its paws stretched out in front of it, its head lowered, lying in a feeble, sickly posture—utterly lacking in majesty.

The symbolism was not hard to grasp: the dragon curls in repose, the tiger lies down.

This was a subtle warning to Meng Zhao—be cautious in the family, and avoid doing things that should not be done.

At first, Meng Wen had expected this to be a thoughtful gift, anticipating that it might help resolve their prior discord, easing his own concerns.

However, upon seeing the stone tiger, his expression faltered, his heart cooling considerably.

This was clearly a move to publicly humiliate him, and it seemed that Meng Qinghuai had no intention of letting the matter rest without a conflict.

What puzzled Meng Wen further was that, for all of Meng Qinghuai’s usual brusque demeanor, he had never before been so petty, so small-minded. Why this sudden display of resentment?

What worried him even more was that Meng Zhao, too, had stopped looking calm and composed. Instead, his expression grew darker, and a deep anger flickered in his eyes, as if about to erupt at any moment.

"I cannot allow them to clash directly."

This thought surged in Meng Wen’s mind. If a fight were to break out, should he side with Meng Zhao, his cousin, who was about to inherit the Second Branch’s estate, or with Meng Qinghuai, his trusted ally and long-time confidant?

The former was his cousin, a key player in the family’s future and a strong competitor for the family leadership. It was vital to win him over, not alienate him.

The latter was his right-hand man, a deep bond forged over the years. He couldn’t afford to disappoint him either.

Thus, in a decisive moment, Meng Wen forced a casual expression, tugged at Meng Qinghuai’s sleeve, and reproached him lightly.

"Qinghuai, this gift of yours is rather meager, isn’t it? It’s hardly presentable. There’s no need to embarrass yourself."

"If we’re talking about gifts, let me show you the one I’ve prepared."

Without waiting for Meng Qinghuai’s reaction, Meng Wen clapped his hands.

After three crisp sounds, a flurry of brilliant flower petals, like butterflies, swirled into the air from a nearby flowerbed.

Jade green, snow white, and ocean blue—petals of many different hues fluttered through the air, creating a breathtaking spectacle.

Under the glow of the glass lanterns, the petals danced like a sea of flowers, and from amidst this beauty emerged a stunning woman, dressed in a pink water gown, a white fox fur draped over her shoulders.

Her figure was graceful, her skin fairer than snow, and her slender frame moved with the elegance of a painting brought to life. Her long black hair was styled in a lofty cloud-like bun.

With delicate features and a soft, harmonious bone structure, she exuded an ethereal beauty that left a lasting impression.

If one had to sum up her allure in one word, it would be "elegance." A refined, unearthly beauty that suggested she was beyond the mundane world.

Even though Meng Zhao had been bombarded with countless images of beautiful women through the internet in his previous life, he was still captivated by her beauty.

And as if designed to enhance her entrance, the fluttering petals added an almost otherworldly touch.

It was truly a spectacle—though Meng Zhao couldn't help but feel a twinge of wariness. He activated his Buddhist meditation technique, visualizing the beautiful woman before him as a lifeless skeleton, her flesh decaying, swarming with maggots and flies.

In an instant, all his fleeting emotions of admiration and desire evaporated, and his mind became as still as a monk in deep meditation, free from any worldly distractions.

In terms of controlling desire, his training at the Great Mercy Temple had truly made him a master.
