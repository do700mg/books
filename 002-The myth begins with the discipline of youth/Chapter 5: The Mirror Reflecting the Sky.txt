Meng Zhao strode out with determined steps, not once turning back as he made his way down the stone corridor.

Lu Le, wearing a worried expression, trailed behind him.

When the two returned to the Western Courtyard, Meng Zhao’s previously warm and composed smile faded, his voice cold as he spoke,

“Ah Le, send word to Meng Wen, tell him that Meng Qinghuai has been secretly in contact with the eldest son, Meng Xi, and may not be loyal to him.

Also, subtly hint at how his behavior today was so unusual, targeting me as though it were for the eldest son’s benefit.

Be discreet, we don’t want to expose ourselves.”

Lu Le was somewhat taken aback, not because the task was difficult, but because it was too simple.

He had thought Meng Zhao would send him to deal with Meng Qinghuai physically, to vent his frustrations, but instead, he was merely asked to spread a rumor. Hesitant, he replied,

“Meng Qinghuai and the second son have been close for a long time, their bond is deep. He may not believe such rumors.

If the young master is truly displeased with his actions tonight, perhaps I should teach Meng Qinghuai a lesson?”

Meng Zhao had no doubt about Lu Le's capabilities; after all, he was the adopted son of Lü Zhong, and now, the only person in his inner circle whom he trusted.

Mobilizing the forces under the second branch to teach a junior from a collateral line a lesson was not difficult.

However, Meng Zhao disliked unnecessary complications. If he were to act, it would either be with total precision or not at all.

A minor reprimand would only escalate tensions, offering no real benefit to him. It might even bring future trouble.

Shaking his head, he replied,

“No, do as I said. Regardless of their relationship or the reason for Meng Qinghuai’s hostility tonight, all we need is to give Meng Wen a reason to doubt him.”

In his previous life, Meng Zhao had endured much hardship, learning patience and subtlety.

Had he been rash or overt in suppressing Meng Qinghuai, he might have played into someone else’s hands.

After all, Meng Wen had been very protective of Meng Qinghuai tonight, trying to smooth things over. What Meng Zhao was doing now was to place a thorn between them—whether successful or not, it would surely irritate them.

Lu Le nodded in agreement.

Then, as though struck by a thought, he took a jade Buddha bead from his sleeve and handed it to Meng Zhao with a smile, saying,

“Master, judging by my eyes, this bead is made from the rare Bi Xuan Spirit Jade, its aura is quite compelling.

Long-term use can nourish one’s vital essence, absorbing toxins and impurities from the body—quite valuable indeed.

The string holding the beads is made of silk from the Ice Silkworm, unbreakable by sword or axe, and can purify the mind and maintain inner peace.

It will greatly benefit you, Master. Such a gift from the second son is indeed not light.”

Meng Zhao had initially felt indifferent to the Buddha bead, but he accepted it, drawn by an inexplicable urge, fearing that such an opportunity might slip away.

Upon hearing Lu Le’s explanation, however, he felt a newfound interest.

This world was vast and mysterious, filled with wonders and unimaginable powers.

Thus, rare treasures and exotic beasts abounded. Though Bi Xuan Spirit Jade and Ice Silkworm silk might not rank among the earth’s rarest treasures, they were certainly considered the finest among common items.

As he took the jade Buddha bead, Meng Zhao’s palm quivered, and a strong pull emanated from his body, drawing a strange energy from the bead. A profound sense of satisfaction coursed through him, reaching deep within his soul.

Yet when he looked down, the bead appeared unchanged—its luster intact, its aura undiminished.

Meng Zhao felt a surge of suspicion and curiosity. He waved for Lu Le to leave and, alone in the courtyard bathed in orange light, began to explore the anomaly within his body.

Sitting on a bench in the west corner of the garden, he closed his eyes, focusing his mind. In the depths of his consciousness, he sensed a weathered copper mirror, glowing with rainbow light, slowly floating before him.

At the same time, a flood of complex information poured into his mind.

After a long while, Meng Zhao finally opened his eyes, his face alight with astonishment. He rose and paced through the quiet courtyard, the jade Buddha bead still in hand, muttering the word “I see” over and over.

The copper mirror in his mind was none other than the Celestial Mirror, a priceless artifact whose rank was unknown but whose power was immense. It had once shattered the barriers of space during a great battle, arriving in the world of his previous life, only to fall silent due to the lack of spiritual energy in that age.

By chance, during a violent encounter, Meng Zhao had been struck on the head by this mirror, its bloodstained surface bonding with him, awakening its dormant spirit. It briefly regained some of its powers before consuming its energy in transporting him to this world.

However, the Celestial Mirror had been severely damaged during its journey, and it lacked the spiritual essence needed to function fully. It could only act on instinct.

But today, as Meng Wen gifted him the jade Buddha bead, the energy contained within it resonated with the mirror’s latent power. This triggered the mirror’s awakening and helped Meng Zhao realize the circumstances behind his acquisition of the bead.

Now that he possessed the Celestial Mirror, Meng Zhao not only had confidence in surviving the dual pressures from mysterious forces and the Meng family, but he might also use it to solidify his identity, breaking free from the control of the mysterious individual.

He calmed himself and began to contemplate the mirror's powers.

In its prime, the Celestial Mirror was a versatile treasure, blending attack, defense, and support in one, capable of unimaginable feats, especially in the realm of space-time manipulation.

It could rival legendary artifacts like the Kunlun Mirror or the Haotian Mirror.

Sadly, due to its current state of disrepair, only its cultivation support function remained, yet this was no small matter.

According to the information he now had, as long as the Celestial Mirror was supplied with energy, it could be used to analyze, deduce, and even integrate martial arts.

If it could be restored, it would unlock even more powerful abilities.

The only problem was the rare and difficult-to-obtain energy required to activate the mirror. This energy, which seemed to be a form of spiritual force, was elusive and abstract.

For example, the jade Buddha bead contained the Buddhist aura of a revered monk, which awakened the Celestial Mirror’s abilities and allowed Meng Zhao to absorb its energy.

"It's a pity," Meng Zhao thought, "The function is still too vague. If only it could be more concrete."

No sooner had the thought entered his mind than the Celestial Mirror surged within his consciousness, its light swirling.

New information flooded into his vision:

**Name**: Meng Zhao  
**Physique**: ?????  
**Energy**: 1002  
**Cultivation**: Qi Accumulation to Sea (Opening the Lake Dantian)  
**Martial Arts**:  
- Arhat Boy Technique (Entry)  
- Thirteen Arhat Hands (Entry)  
- Plum Blossom Stance (Entry)  
**Martial Arts Fusion**: Status (Closed)

Meng Zhao was thrilled. The Celestial Mirror had indeed comprehended his wish, transforming its vague function into something far clearer.

The Fusion Martial Arts function was still locked, but that aside, he could now focus on the three martial arts techniques he had learned. Though he had just begun training and lacked deep understanding, they were now within his grasp.

With the energy from the Celestial Mirror, he could deepen his mastery of these techniques.

For instance, the Arhat Boy Technique had been initiated with great inner strength through a monk’s blessing, but his control was still rudimentary. Now, however, the mirror's power could enhance his understanding, bringing him closer to true mastery.

With enough energy, Meng Zhao believed he could surpass the greatest martial geniuses of both past and future.

As for the energy source, Meng Zhao had an idea. Ancient artifacts seemed to be the most suitable carriers of such energy, especially those handled by spiritually strong individuals over long periods.

He recalled that there were likely such treasures in the second branch’s treasury, and he resolved to seek them out.

Additionally, the Celestial Mirror had sensing abilities, able to detect items infused with energy nearby, just as it had done with the jade Buddha bead.

What puzzled Meng Zhao, however, was the “?????” under the physique section. Could his body hold some secret?

He felt a twinge of curiosity, eager to uncover the mystery.
