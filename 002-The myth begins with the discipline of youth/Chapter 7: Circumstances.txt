The next morning, as the first light of dawn broke, Meng Zhao, attended by Lü Le, finished his morning ablutions. He donned a fresh, light pink robe that was both cool and comfortable, then seated himself in the room to enjoy breakfast.

The meal consisted of three simple pastries, eight varieties of side dishes, dried fruits, and vegetables. Not only were they visually appealing, fragrant, and flavorful, but they also harbored hidden significance.

Some of the dishes contained rare and precious herbal essences, while others were concocted from the blood and flesh of fierce beasts.

Once consumed, they would infuse the body with vitality, a crucial resource for martial practitioners seeking to cultivate their inner power.

The first step in martial arts training is the postnatal realm, which focuses on strengthening the foundation and accumulating internal energy.

This stage involves techniques such as breath control to condense essence, the accumulation of energy to form an ocean, and the opening of meridians (beginning, minor, and major success), all of which follow this principle.

The thicker one’s internal energy, the deeper their foundation, and the broader their future prospects in martial arts.

Internal energy does not arise spontaneously; it must be refined from one’s essence using special martial arts techniques.

However, a person's essence is limited. Whether innate or acquired, excessive depletion can lead to depletion or even fatal damage.

Therefore, external supplementation is necessary, such as rare elixirs, precious ingredients, and other resources.

The strongest martial artists often come from prestigious families or sects, as they have access to these resources.

Even innate prodigies cannot reach their full potential without support. No matter how talented, a lack of resources can lead to mediocrity.

Thus, Meng Zhao bore no resentment towards the mysterious person who sent him to impersonate a member of the Meng family. The benefits far outweighed any misgivings.

While Meng Zhao was eating, Lü Le, whose round face exuded a jovial charm, stood by his side. Dressed in a brown tunic, he held a blue-covered booklet and slowly began to tell Meng Zhao about the second branch's businesses and influence.

First, Lü Le discussed the removal of shared businesses with the first and third branches. In recent years, the second branch’s influence over these enterprises had waned, leaving them with only dividends and little involvement.

The remaining assets were solely managed by the second branch—properties, farmland, shops—numerous and complex, radiating out from the heart of Nan'an Prefecture to encompass much of Ji Province.

In fact, the second branch employed over a hundred stewards and managers, thriving in a way that could not have been achieved without the powerful backing of the Meng family and Lü Zhong, the chief steward of the second branch and Lü Le’s adoptive father.

Aside from wealth, the second branch also nurtured a group of martial artists. Some were promising but lacked resources, others were already accomplished but had made enemies, while some were ruthless outlaws, driven to murder for money and martial arts resources.

In summary, the second branch had both wealth and manpower, strong connections, and backing.

Even if they were to be separated from the Meng family, they would still stand out in Ji Province, not quite dominating, but capable of maintaining their own territory.

However, before Meng Zhao could bask in his newfound success, Lü Le mentioned several matters that soured his mood.

First, the eldest branch’s brothers, Meng Xi and Meng Wen, had placed people within the second branch’s businesses, primarily in Nan'an Prefecture and nearby counties. Over the years, they had taken substantial sums from the second branch.

As these two brothers were embroiled in a fierce rivalry, the unclaimed resources of the second branch had not gone unnoticed.

Although they had refrained from extreme actions due to the presence of their elders, the rivalry was evident. With Meng Zhao so far away in Yujing, Lü Zhong, an old servant, could only turn a blind eye.

Second, in the past year, there had been frequent tensions between the Meng family and the Sun family, another powerful clan. Their rivalry had escalated, and naturally, the second branch’s businesses had suffered from Sun family influence, resulting in significant losses.

The most recent incident occurred five days ago, when a farm owned by the second branch outside Nan'an Prefecture was attacked. Eight martial artists guarding the estate were killed, and considerable property was lost, including thirty acres of medicinal fields set ablaze and two large warehouses of herbs stolen.

Lü Zhong had been investigating this matter for the past few days and had made progress.

According to the latest intelligence, the culprit behind the attack was likely a reckless young man from the Sun family named Sun Chanshan.

Apparently, Sun Chanshan had accumulated a significant debt and, unable to approach his family, had turned to the Meng family’s businesses to fill the gap, taking advantage of the conflict between the two families.

Though the elders might discover the truth, Sun Chanshan could easily cover up his actions with a plausible excuse.

Lü Le finished recounting the details, closed the booklet, and waited quietly for instructions.

Meanwhile, Meng Zhao continued to sip the fragrant medicinal porridge with a silver spoon, contemplating his current situation.

"Internal strife and external threats.

Within the family, the eldest branch’s brothers are unsettling, tangled in a power struggle over the family headship, and have long infiltrated the second branch’s businesses.

I have no desire to become involved, but in the martial world, one is rarely in control of their fate. The future is unpredictable.

Externally, the Sun family poses a serious problem. To challenge the Meng family, they must be a formidable force, with likely powerful backing.

Fortunately, the entire Meng family is at the forefront of this struggle, not just the second branch. If it were the second branch alone, I would not be able to bear it."

Originally, Meng Zhao had been sent to infiltrate the Meng family, merely playing the role of the second branch’s young master, with no other directive.

Given this, his best course of action was to maintain the status quo, remain inconspicuous, and avoid making mistakes.

But now, with the Mirror of Heaven in his possession, his confidence had grown, and Meng Zhao, no longer content with mere survival, was beginning to entertain thoughts of usurping the rightful heir, wishing to seize control of the second branch and, perhaps, the entire Meng family.

If heaven had placed him in this world with the same appearance and body as the true Meng Zhao, then he would make full use of this opportunity to solidify his identity.

As for his past as a beggar, and his unremarkable origins, they held no meaning for him as a transmigrator.

The path forward was clear: first, he needed to strengthen himself.

With enough strength, even if his identity were exposed, he could protect himself, and perhaps even build his own power in the martial world.

To achieve this in the shortest time possible, he would need to make full use of the Mirror of Heaven and the energy points it contained.

Next, he needed to win the favor and trust of his elders while consolidating control over the resources and power at his disposal.

With wealth, manpower, and influence, he could confront the mysterious figure who had controlled him and ultimately break free.

Lone warriors existed, but Meng Zhao recognized that he lacked the strength for such a path in the short term.

Most importantly, he was bound by a mysterious poison that had been implanted to control him, requiring regular doses of an antidote to suppress its effects, or else it would threaten his life.

This poison hung over his head like a sword, a leash around his neck, constantly threatening and humiliating him.

To cure the poison, personal strength alone might not suffice. Most likely, he would need to rely on external power to find a skilled healer or rare medicine.

Only by gaining true freedom, breaking free from the mysterious person’s control, would Meng Zhao have the time and peace of mind to consider his future and the path ahead.

Having come to this conclusion, Meng Zhao felt no further confusion and quickly finished his meal.

Streams of fiery vitality surged from his abdomen, spreading through his body, filling him with the warmth and comfort of a hot spring.

It nourished his body, strengthened his blood, and was eventually absorbed by his Lohan Tongzi Gong, transforming into pure internal energy, stored in his dantian, preparing for the next phase of cultivation.
