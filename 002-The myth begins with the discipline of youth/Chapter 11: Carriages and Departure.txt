At the early hours of the day, despite the sun's relentless heat, everything was already prepared.

Lü Le, who walked beside Meng Zhao holding an umbrella to shield him from the sun, exited through the side gate of the Western Courtyard, stopping just outside the half-foot-high crimson threshold.

He glanced at the formation of the guards and was visibly pleased.

Thirty personal bodyguards, all elite warriors—though their statures varied, some tall and some short, some slender and others stocky—yet the air of martial prowess they exuded was unmistakably the same.

Moreover, many of them displayed a sharp, cutting edge in their eyes—a killing intent Meng Zhao had become well-acquainted with over the past year.

According to Lü Le, most of them were only at the stage of the Qi Condensation Realm, the entry-level of martial cultivation, but they had cultivated internal energy. When they struck, their power was amplified by their inner force, a stark contrast to the brute strength of common brawlers. These men had truly stepped into the realm of martial arts.

Furthermore, they had faced numerous battles and skirmishes, and their experience made them even more formidable than ordinary practitioners.

The steeds accompanying these warriors were equally impressive—sleek black steeds, each equipped with saddle and stirrups, known for their stamina and agility.

These magnificent horses, famed for their resilience and speed, hailed from Liangzhou in the northern reaches of Dayong. Their sleek black coats shimmered, and their noble bearing made them ideal for long-distance travel, the preferred mount of border cavalry.

A rider skilled in horsemanship could harness the full power of these horses, adding considerable strength to their strikes.

Such prized steeds were costly to acquire, and maintaining them required astronomical sums. Only the wealthiest families could afford to keep them.

The bodyguards escorting Meng Zhao rode these prized horses, a subtle indication of the Meng family's considerable wealth.

However, these thirty exceptional horses paled in comparison to the two divine steeds pulling the carriage.

These two beasts were nearly ten feet tall, their muscular frames exuding raw power. Their eyes gleamed with a menacing red, and an aura of deadly ferocity surrounded them, causing even the other horses to shrink back in fear.

What set them apart was not just their size and strength, but their skin—shiny, black, and metallic, resembling scales rather than fur.

Their scales were seamless, and upon occasion, their mouths revealed razor-sharp teeth like a saw blade, adding to their terrifying presence.

Though they resembled horses, they were far stronger than the ordinary horses of the world.

These creatures bore the bloodline of a fierce beast, endowed with immense strength and a volatile temperament. They required a diet of raw flesh to maintain their energy, and once tamed, they were far superior to ordinary steeds.

In terms of strength, it was likely that none of the bodyguards could match these two divine horses.

As Meng Zhao observed quietly, two distinct figures emerged from the ranks of the guards, exuding a formidable presence.

One was a towering figure, dressed in a half-sleeve black tunic, his muscles solid and unyielding like stone. A long scar, stretching from his brow to his left cheek, marred his face, resembling a centipede's trail. The scar drew so much attention that it obscured the rest of his features.

This was Scarface, a man whose real name was unknown. He had once been pursued by enemies and sought refuge under the Meng family’s protection, gradually adapting to life within the clan over the years.

The other man appeared more ordinary, dressed in a simple blue robe that covered his entire body. He seemed unremarkable in a crowd, but when he stepped forward, a dense and profound aura emanated from him, setting him apart.

Meng Zhao took special note of his hands—larger than normal, calloused and rough, with protruding knuckles. As he moved, his arms swung with a power that made the veins on his hands bulge, resembling worms beneath the skin—an unsettling sight of explosive strength.

Scarface and Wang Tao, the Mountain Breaker, were both experts who had reached the pinnacle of the acquired stage, their internal energy flowing freely through their meridians. In terms of cultivation, they surpassed Meng Zhao.

However, in Meng Zhao's presence, they bowed respectfully, kneeling slightly in reverence, acknowledging that, in a certain sense, everything they had, including their martial prowess, belonged to the Meng family.

“Scarface (Wang Tao) greets the young master,” they said, their tone full of respect.

This was not their first time meeting Meng Zhao; they had previously escorted him on a journey to return to the family. However, unlike their previous subdued and distant demeanor, this time Meng Zhao had left a favorable impression on them, and they now looked forward to the future, particularly to the Second House.

A smile spread across Meng Zhao's refined face as he slowly twisted his jade Buddhist beads with his right hand, extending his left in a gesture of invitation.

“Please, rise. My journey to the estate outside the city will depend on your protection,” he said with grace.

Even though he was the head of the company, these two men were still considered high-level talent, deserving of respect.

They both stood and exchanged pleasantries before informing Meng Zhao of the route they would take outside the city, the estimated travel time, and the potential dangers along the way, as well as the formation of their guards.

Their professionalism was evident—cautious yet efficient, with an emphasis on leveraging their strengths to minimize risk.

The primary goal was clear: to strengthen protection and reduce any possible threats.

They accounted for every possible danger, from hidden enemies to the unlikely appearance of fierce beasts.

Meng Zhao had no objections and gave his full trust and respect to the two men.

He then boarded the opulent carriage pulled by the two divine horses.

Lü Le, holding a long black whip studded with spikes, jumped onto the front compartment, temporarily assuming the role of the driver, guiding the powerful steeds.

Given the ferocity of the divine horses, no ordinary coachman could handle them; Lü Le took on the task in their stead.

The Meng family guards, under the command of Scarface and Wang Tao, mounted the steeds, forming several groups to escort the carriage, which proceeded slowly down the long street.

The side gate of the Western Courtyard was located in a quiet, secluded area, surrounded by wealthy homes. At first, there were few pedestrians.

Once they emerged onto the main street, however, the area became bustling and lively.

The main street was wide, straight, and impeccably clean, wide enough to accommodate three carriages side by side.

On either side, there were terraced buildings, towering structures, and well-maintained houses, all gleaming with prosperity.

Vendors lined the streets, creating two long serpentine rows, while the crowd swelled with a diverse mix of people—rich and poor, old and young, men and women, all contributing to the vibrant energy of the city.

As the procession passed, it drew countless eyes—mostly filled with fear, but a few with envy and admiration.

When the procession approached, everyone instinctively moved aside, making way for the carriages and their accompanying riders.

Commoners, wealthy merchants, and even the rough-looking men from the streets all stepped aside respectfully.

Inside the carriage, Meng Zhao, with his sharp hearing, could catch snippets of conversation from the crowd.

Most of it was praise for the Meng family's martial prowess and influence, though some murmured discontent, criticizing the family's ostentation. These voices were quickly drowned out by the tide of admiration.

At times, he passed other splendidly adorned carriages, their owners clearly of high status. Upon recognizing that it was a Meng family member approaching, they would respectfully dismount and allow Meng Zhao’s procession to pass.

This only served to underscore the Meng family's dominance and authority.

With a sigh, Meng Zhao lowered the curtain of the carriage window, his bright eyes reflecting a hint of admiration.

“The powerful families of Jizhou truly live up to their reputation—unparalleled in grandeur.”
