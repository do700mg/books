Taking a brief respite to allow his mind to recover, Meng Zhao once again immersed himself in the two martial arts he had enhanced through the Mirror of the Heavens.

His motivation was twofold: caution, not wanting to leave any hidden dangers behind, and an unshakable passion for the martial path, a force beyond the ordinary.

After all, having lived two lives, especially in his previous one where the world seemed to be in its final, decadent age, he was acutely aware of what possessing such power truly entailed.

At midday, the sun hung in the sky like a massive fireball, emitting boundless light and heat, scorching the earth and causing moisture to evaporate. The entire city of Nan'an was enveloped in a sweltering heatwave.

Under the influence of his powerful family background, Meng Zhao had come to appreciate the pleasures of wealth and privilege.

Endless supplies of warm water, neither too hot nor too cold, allowed him to luxuriate in baths resembling hot springs, while others, drenched in sweat and laboring for their livelihoods, struggled in the heat. His fatigue melted away in the soothing water.

After enjoying medicinal meals prepared by the house’s chef, he had refreshing plum soup cooled with ice cubes and chilled watermelon as dessert.

If he still felt overheated, he could retreat indoors to enjoy the cool air. The walls of the house were hollowed out and filled with ice blocks, providing rudimentary but effective air conditioning.

In fact, such comforts were commonplace in Meng Zhao's previous world, where even ordinary households could afford them—if not better, more varied versions. 

But in this world, such luxuries were the exclusive domain of the powerful and influential.

This disparity in the world was a given—if one wished to obtain something, they inevitably had to sacrifice something else.

As Meng Zhao, now in a water-blue Shu brocade shirt, sat in his study, browsing through a collection of bizarre and obscure records, Lü Le dashed in with excitement. After greeting him, he eagerly reported,

"Master, good news! The men placed by the second young master in our family’s holdings have resigned. We can finally breathe a sigh of relief!"

Lü Le was genuinely pleased. Before Meng Zhao’s return, the vast estates of the second branch had been little more than a financial reservoir for Meng Xi and Meng Wen. Whenever they needed something, they simply took it, and even Lü Zhong, the chief steward, could only turn a blind eye.

Now that Meng Zhao had returned as the rightful master, Meng Wen finally realized it was time to pull back. Lü Le, who had been worried about the brothers’ insatiable greed, could finally relax.

Indeed, with the return of the young master, everything was falling into place, and the second branch would soon flourish again.

However, the men under Meng Xi seemed unmoved.

Meng Zhao placed the scroll he had been reading aside, absentmindedly turning the jade Buddha beads in his hand.

These beads were quite exceptional, providing both physical and mental benefits, subtly drawing one into a trance from which it was hard to escape.

His face remained expressionless as he spoke calmly, "It’s a normal development. I offer them a peach, and they return it with a plum. There’s no need to be overly excited.

Prepare the transition carefully. Ensure everything moves smoothly to avoid any unnecessary setbacks. If necessary, let Meng Wen’s men stay another month to ensure a proper handover.

After all, the people under the eldest, Meng Xi, have yet to make a move. Furthermore, the Sun family is not friendly with us, so we must remain cautious."

Lü Le was somewhat taken aback but, more than that, he was impressed.

He hadn’t expected Meng Zhao, who had spent ten years in a Buddhist monastery, to display such composure. His sudden elation over the good news had clouded his judgment, and now he saw the deeper potential dangers.

"Yes, Master. I will ensure everything is handled with the utmost care, so you won’t be disappointed."

Meng Zhao nodded thoughtfully, then suddenly asked, "By the way, have you arranged the guards for this afternoon’s visit to the estate outside the city? What’s their ability?"

The Meng family’s martial strength came from a variety of sources. They had influence in the military and even ties to the renowned Heavenly Punishment Hall. Their control over numerous martial arts factions, security firms, and training halls also contributed to their armed power.

The men who patrolled Meng Zhao’s estate were typically former soldiers or apprentices from martial arts halls—strong in discipline but generally not remarkable in terms of fighting prowess. A few skilled fighters mixed in ensured the security of the Meng family.

In Nan'an city, few dared to challenge the Meng family.

However, outside the city, reputation and influence mattered little. Only martial strength could be relied upon.

Lü Le's expression turned serious as he replied, "Rest assured, Master. I know the times are unsettled, so I’ve carefully selected two top-tier martial artists from my adoptive father’s ranks to protect you. One is named Scarface, skilled in blade techniques and throwing weapons. He once fought four opponents alone and killed two of equal rank. He is fierce, fearless, and unflinching in the face of death.

The other is Wang Tao, a master of palm strikes and lightness techniques, highly praised by my adoptive father. He’s known as the ‘Mountain-Cleaver.’ His skills surpass those of Scarface. Along with thirty more agile guards at the late-stage of Houtian, armed with steel blades, crossbows, and mounted on fine horses, your safety is thoroughly ensured."

Meng Zhao assessed the strength of the guards, and he was quite satisfied.

Although this world was rich with ancient myths and legends, where powerful beings could destroy the heavens, in the current era, martial arts were in a state of decline, weaker than ever before.

Most martial artists were at the Houtian level, which was considered ordinary. Only those at the Xiantian level could be called true masters, capable of extraordinary feats. The so-called "Ten Unrivaled Masters" were the ultimate authorities, invincible in their domain.

Even though the Meng family was a dominant force in Nan'an, the number of Xiantian experts they could muster was limited, and they were unlikely to have any among the guards.

Thus, Meng Zhao felt content with Lü Le’s arrangements. Given his current humble demeanor, if he were to be killed by a Xiantian expert during a trip outside the city, he would accept it as fate.

"Very good. In addition to these men, prepare some silver. When we reach the estate, we will send some to the families of those who have suffered casualties, as a gesture of goodwill from me.

Should they face any difficulties in the future, we will prioritize helping them."

The usual compensation had already been issued by Lü Zhong, so these silver coins were a personal act of kindness from Meng Zhao.

A good reputation was essential for him. A noble, majestic image was what most people aspired to and trusted.

Moreover, as someone who had come from the Great Compassionate Temple, his kindness was in line with his background.

The amount of silver involved meant little to him. What mattered was the persona he was crafting—a persona of benevolence.

Furthermore, for Meng Zhao, whose heart harbored hidden malice like a venomous snake watching the Meng family, this act of kindness also served to deceive the first branch brothers and even the family elders.

Though he had no immediate plans to seize the family headship, the ambition was there.

The seeds he planted were merely casual foreshadowing. Whether they would bear fruit was of no concern to him.

Lü Le, unaware of these deeper motivations, believed wholeheartedly in the young master’s kindness and was touched by his empathy for the common folk.

He bowed respectfully and left the room.

Meng Zhao, with his fingers still playing with the Buddha beads, gazed into the distance, a faint smile playing on his lips.

The roles of hunter and prey were not fixed. 

With the Mirror of the Heavens and the resources of the second branch at his disposal, he was confident that his period of waiting would not last long.
