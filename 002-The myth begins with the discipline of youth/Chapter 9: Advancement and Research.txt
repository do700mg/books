In the tranquil and spacious courtyard, the pale blue stone slabs were meticulously swept clean, and the air carried the delicate fragrance of blooming flowers and fresh grass.

Meng Zhao, with his wide sleeves fluttering, his long hair neatly combed, lay back on a wicker chair in the corner of the eastern courtyard.

Beside him was a cup of fragrant tea, still emitting a faint vapor, and he appeared to be thoroughly enjoying his moment, as if savoring the pleasures of life.

Yet, at that moment, his mind was completely absorbed by the reflection in the Zhaotian Mirror.

He interacted with the interface displayed by the mirror, elevating the Thirteen Arhat Fist from its introductory level to the minor mastery stage.

On the interface, the energy points, which had been 5400, suddenly shifted to 4900.

At the same time, a torrential flow of information surged out of the Zhaotian Mirror, pouring into his mental sea.

It felt as though someone had pried open his skull and crammed a multitude of sensations into his brain.

The intense sensation caused Meng Zhao to unconsciously groan softly, his face contorting in pain, his features twisted.

In the blink of an eye, the expanding agony, which seemed on the verge of tearing him apart, gradually faded.

What followed was a heavy, exhausted sensation, as though he hadn’t slept for days.

In his mind, he gained an inexplicable understanding of the martial techniques, despite having never physically experienced them, as if they had been etched into his soul.

Subjectively, this brutal form of learning seemed harsh, placing a heavy burden on the spirit.

However, unexpectedly, the results were remarkable.

Meng Zhao, whose eyes had been half-closed, suddenly opened them wide. His bloodshot gaze briefly flickered with a faint purple light, a fleeting gleam unnoticed even by himself.

In the next moment, like a awakened tiger, he sprang into the courtyard and began performing the Thirteen Arhat Fist.

The monk holding the sutra, drunk amidst a chain of rings, the child offering treasures...

The movements were forceful and fluid, with each strike flowing seamlessly into the next, simple in form yet creating an intricate and ever-changing pattern.

His arms, infused with internal power, became blurs of motion.

As he struck, a fierce wind was stirred, sweeping outward, with the crackling sound of air being pierced, as relentless as the popping of beans in hot oil.

The power was overwhelming and terrifying, each punch and kick capable of delivering a fatal blow.

Not just flesh and bone, even stone seemed as though it could be shattered by a single strike.

This was not only because Meng Zhao had reached the minor mastery level of this martial art, where every move became second nature to him.

The technique of harnessing full-body strength had greatly improved, and his strikes now resembled the force of whips or hammers.

What made the performance truly terrifying, however, was the infusion of the robust Arhat Child’s internal power, adding explosive might to each movement.

Before long, Meng Zhao completed three full rounds of the fist technique, taking long breaths to gradually calm the surging internal energy.

He then stood with his feet slightly apart, hands hanging naturally at his sides, lost in contemplation.

The Thirteen Arhat Fist was the most basic martial art at the Great Compassion Temple, its power moderate, with few variations.

At the introductory level, it was merely about performing the moves fluidly to build the body. It had little advantage in combat.

But with the aid of the Zhaotian Mirror, Meng Zhao’s understanding of the art had skyrocketed.

In the span of a few moments, he had not only achieved minor mastery, but his progress was already nearing the threshold of major mastery.

Even the simplest techniques had evolved into something far more dynamic.

And the price of this transformation? A mere five hundred energy points, with results that exceeded his expectations.

In terms of combat strength, Meng Zhao was now likely ten times stronger than before.

Were the monks practicing the Thirteen Arhat Fist alongside him to see this, they would surely be consumed with envy.

“The transition between moves is seamless, without a hint of awkwardness, as though this were the result of my own diligent training.

Perhaps the body needs a brief period to adapt, but it’s only a fleeting moment and hardly worth considering a hindrance.

If there is any downside, it would be the brutal nature of the experience, which places a heavy strain on the mind.”

Meng Zhao extended his long, fair fingers and gently massaged his still swollen forehead, quietly reflecting.

“Elevating the Thirteen Arhat Fist from introductory to minor mastery only cost five hundred energy points.

But what about elevating the Arhat Child’s skill to minor mastery?”

Not willing to dwell on the matter, Meng Zhao, with ample energy points at his disposal and knowing the value of the Arhat Child’s technique, wasted no time in diving into the process.

This time, the change in energy points exceeded his expectations. What was 4900 points suddenly dropped to 3900, and once again, a flood of information surged into his mind, more intense and painful than before.

Standing steady moments before, Meng Zhao now swayed, his body rocking back and forth, on the verge of collapsing.

His complexion had turned pale, the blood vessels in his eyes more pronounced, as if they might burst at any moment.

Blood trickled from his nose, staining his pale robes in stark red streaks, a conspicuous sight.

Yet, alongside the physical and mental discomfort, there came a wealth of martial insights.

Unable to focus on the pain, Meng Zhao instead channeled all his energy into refining the technique.

The Arhat Child’s skill was the temple’s pinnacle internal cultivation method, known for assisting in the development of one’s energy.

It not only refined internal strength but also fostered the rare and valuable Pure Yang Child Qi.

This rare energy possessed remarkable effects, strengthening the bones, enhancing one’s innate abilities, expelling evil forces, and providing exceptional support for mastering more advanced internal martial arts.

According to the scripture, the cultivation stages were: Rough Concentration, Proper Concentration, Renunciation of Desire, and Complete Awareness.

Originally, Meng Zhao was at the Rough Concentration level, where he could only focus during training, barely able to harness the vast energy within without suffering backlash, and his efficiency was poor.

Now, he had advanced to the Proper Concentration stage, where his movements were focused, and his thoughts aligned, with no distractions.

Not only had his control over his internal energy improved, but the efficiency of his cultivation had also increased dramatically.

For instance, the absorption and transformation of vital energy, which once took an hour at the Rough Concentration stage, now only took half the time, if not less, and the internal power was purer and stronger.

In the short term, the difference seemed negligible, but over time, the gap would grow wider, especially with sufficient resources.

Meng Zhao wiped the blood from his nose, steadied his swaying body, and concentrated on calming the discomfort.

Once the bleeding stopped and the pain in his head receded, he examined the information displayed on the Zhaotian Mirror.

Energy points: 3900. The Arhat Child’s skill had advanced to minor mastery, but the path ahead was still unclear.

Clearly, 3900 energy points were insufficient to elevate the skill to major mastery.

However, the Thirteen Arhat Fist still had progress to be made.

Meng Zhao chose to ignore it, instead focusing intently and throwing a punch into the empty air, carefully sensing the result.

The punch, seemingly ordinary, carried the pure, potent internal energy that surged forward like a volcanic eruption.

The force pierced the air, releasing a sharp, whistling sound.

In terms of raw power, it was nearly fifty percent stronger than his previous Arhat Fist.

In just a short time, the double enhancement of his internal energy techniques had caused a dramatic transformation in Meng Zhao’s martial prowess.

If before, he had been like a fat pig with great strength but little control, now he had become a fierce tiger, sharp claws and fangs ready to strike.

However, the price of this strength was becoming evident. The strain on his mind was too great, and he could not endure multiple intense enhancements in succession.

Like the relationship between water and its container, the boundless ocean could not be contained by a mere clay pot.

His journey from weakness to strength could not be achieved overnight; it was a gradual, step-by-step process.

Thus, to grow stronger, the Zhaotian Mirror was an invaluable tool, but its use required wisdom.

One could pursue power, but one must never lose oneself in it, lest they become a slave to their own strength.
